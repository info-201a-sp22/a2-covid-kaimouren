# A2: U.S. COVID Trends

## Overview
In many ways, we have come to understand the gravity and trends in the COVID-19 pandemic through data. Regardless of media source, people are consuming more epidemiological information than ever, primarily through reported figures, charts, and maps.

This assignment is your opportunity to work directly with the same data used by the [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/). While the analysis is guided through a series of questions, it is your opportunity to use programming skills to ask more detailed questions about the pandemic.

## Getting Started
You should start this assignment by opening up the `analysis.R` script. The script will guide you through an initial analysis of the data.

* **Coding prompts.** Complete the coding prompts in `analysis.R`.

* **Reflection prompts.** Throughout `analysis.R`, there are prompts labeled `"Reflection"`. Please write at least 1-3 sentences for each of these prompts below in this `README.md` file. As appropriate, provide evidence, give justification for your opinions, or genuinely reflect on your views. Please strive for concise, clear, and interesting writing.

## Reflection 1
Before actually calculating the total number of COVID cases and deaths, record your guesses for the following questions.

Guess: How many total COVID cases do you think there have been in the U.S.?
I think there will be 1,000,000 COVID cases in total in the U.S.
Guess: How many total COVID-related deaths do you think there have been in the U.S.?
I think there will be 10,000 deaths in the U.S.
Guess: Which state do you think has the highest number of COVID cases, and which state do you think has the lowest?
I think California has the highes number of COVID and Texas has the lowest.
## Reflection 2
Did the number of COVID cases and deaths surprise you? Why or why not? What about the states with the highest and lowest number of cases? How did your guesses line up with the actual results? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences
The highest state is the same as my guess because I believe California are the most active state in the US. The state with lowest cases in recent day suprised me because I didn't notie this place before.
## Reflection 3
Which county has the highest number of cases in the state of Washington, and does it surprise you? Why or why not? (You may need to google this county to learn about it) Answer at least in 1-3 sentences
King county. Because King county has the most people at Washington.
## Reflection 4
Why are there so many observations (counties) in the variable `lowest_deaths_in_each_state`? That is, wouldn't you expect the number to be around 50? Why is the number greater than 50? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences
I'm not surprised because the number of deaths has been fluctuating rather than constantly increasing.

## Reflection 5
What do you think about the number and scale of the inconsistencies in the data? Does the fact that there are inconsistencies mean that people should not use this data? Why or why not? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences
I think this difference is quite normal. Different institutions will inevitably have some errors in statistics, but these errors are small so these data can still be used

## Reflection 6
Why were you interested in this particular question? Were you able to answer your question with code? What did you learn? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences
Because I want to know where to do the best outbreak prevention and control. But this result did not surprise me very much.
## Reflection 7
What, if anything, made you curious about this COVID analysis? What, if anything, surprised you? What might you do the same or differently on your next data wrangling project? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences
I would like to know how this data is collected. I got familiar with the way of data analysis and how to get the data I want quickly by code through this assignment.
